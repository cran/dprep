\title{RELIEF Feature Selection}
\description{
This function implements the RELIEF feature selection algorithm.
}
\usage{
relief(data, nosample, threshold,repet=1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{ The dataset for which feature selection will be carried out}
  \item{nosample}{ The number of instances drawn from the original dataset}
  \item{threshold}{ The cutoff point to select the features}
\item{repet}{The number of repetitions. It is recommended to use at most 10 repetitions}
}
\details{
  The general idea of this method is to choose the features that can be most
distinguished between classes. These are known as the relevant features. At 
each step of an iterative process, an instance x is chosen at random from
the dataset and the weight for each feature is updated according to the 
distance of x to its Nearmiss and NearHit. The dataset must have complete cases therefore imputation must be performed in advance.
}
\value{
  \item{relevant}{ A table that gives the ratio between the frequency 
with which the feature was selected as relevant and the total number of
trials performed in one column, and the average weight of the feature
in another.}
 \item{a plot}{ A plot of the weights of the features}
