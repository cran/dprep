\title{Multivariate outlier detection through the boxplot of the Mahalanobis distance}
\description{
This function finds multivariate outliers by constructing a
boxplot of the Mahalanobis distance of all the instances. 
}
\usage{
mahaout(data, nclass=0, plot = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{Name of the dataset}
  \item{nclass}{Number of the class to check for outliers. By default nclass=0 meaning
the column of classes it is not used.}
  \item{plot}{ Logical value. If plot=T a plot of the mahalanobis distance is drawn}
}
\details{
  uses cov.rob function from the MASS library
}
\value{
Returns a list of top outliers according to their Mahalanobis distance and a list of 
all the instances ordered according to their Mahalanobis distance.

If Plot=T, a plot of the instances ranked by their Mahalanobis distance is provided.
